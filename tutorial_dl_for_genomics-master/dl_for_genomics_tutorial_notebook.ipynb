    "In this tutorial we will use a convolutional neuronal network to address a fairly basic but common problem in genomics. Given a set of sequences belonging to different classes, what are the characteristics in the DNA sequence that let us distinguish the classes. For example, given a set of promoter and enhancer sequences, we could ask if there are any patterns in the DNA that let us distinguish between the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a 'simple' example, think of two ChIP-seq experiments for two different transcription factors. After analysing the ChIP-seq data, we know at what positions in the genome the two factors bind and the majority of binding sites might be distinct. If we extract the underlying sequences and search for DNA patterns that are enriched in the respective sets, we get an idea what DNA sequences the transcription factor might bind and/or which co-factors influence their binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, people use motif discovery tools for finding overrepresented words and motifs. However, if we move to slightly more complicated questions these methods quickly reach their limits and machine learning approaches become more promising.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more complicated question: If we have multiple sets of enhancers that are active in different tissues and cell types and we have the underlying sequences, can we figure out what sequence patterns are characteristic for what activity? And once we know that can we infer which factors are common and which are tissue specific?\n",
    "\n",
    "------\n",
    "\n",
    "For our test dataset we have a simplfied, simulated version of such a task. We simulated 40,000 DNA sequences of length 200 bp. We split them into 4 enhancer classes and populated them with transcription factor binding motifs and other DNA patters to make them distinguishable. However, some motifs are shared between classes, they may overlap each other and are not necessarily perfect matches to the text book motifs. Thats much more how regulatory DNA actually looks like :)!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use keras to build and train a small convolutional neuronal network to classify our enhancer sequences. Once this network is trained well, we can than investigate how the network has learned to distinguish between the classes and try to relate this back to transcriptions factor motifs and so on.\n",

We are discarding all nets that do well on the training but worse at the test (overfitted), therefore we always have an intrinsic bias. The validation data set is meant to have never been touched throughout the whole optimization process and we evaluate the perormance of our final model on this set to get an unbiased estimate of its performance.\n"

    "Now that we have a reasonably working model, we also want to inspect and see what the net has learned. In applications, we often don't care what the network has learned as long as it performs well and outperforms our competitors. For many research problems however, we are exactly interested in what the network has learned. What features distinguish a cat from a dog or if it comes to decision making (e.g. health care or self driving cars), we obviously want to be able to understand and be able to justify why a certain decision has been chosen and learn how to correct missbehavior.\n",

    "In genomics we usually want to learn what sequence features distinguish the sequences from one another and map them back to biological properties and factors. The easiest way is to just plot the filter weights. In the first convolutional layer, our filters are just like position weight matrices, multiplying every base at every position with a learned weight and summing the value up (plus a bias and pipe it through the RELU activation function). Unfortunatly, this becomes less straight forward to interpret in deeper layers. There are ways of back engineering and learning the importance of filters in higher layers (e.g. https://github.com/kundajelab/deeplift) but we concern ourself only with the simple first layer here.\n",

Query them in standard motif analysis tools (e.g. http://rsat.sb-roscoff.fr/oligo-analysis_form.cgi or http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme). Do these tools find different or similar things?"
